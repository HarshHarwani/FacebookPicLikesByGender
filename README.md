# FacebookPicLikesByGirls
This is a simple python script which calculates the number of female likes on a particular pic.

See the GraphApi.py file for instructions on how to change the parameters. The script is slow for now, as there are expensive API calls. I will be optimizing this soon.


Every like is analyzed and a gender corresponding to the file is written to the file. The output file is Output.txt
