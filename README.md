# FacebookPicLikesByGirls
* This is a simple python script which calculates the number of female likes on a particular pic.
* See the GraphApi.py file for instructions on how to change the parameters.
* Every like is analyzed and a gender corresponding to the file is written to the file. The output file is Output.txt

##Future work:
* Need a better name for the project ;-)
* The script is slow for now, as there are expensive API calls. I need to optimize this soon. 
* Figure out a way to publish this so that people can use it. currenlty I dont know what will I use to connect python  backend(any pointers on this would be helpful).
* Once the front end is built, I have a lot of other features in mind :)
